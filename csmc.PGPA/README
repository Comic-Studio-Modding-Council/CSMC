================= [Intro] ============CSMC
PGPA is a script to encrypt DM with PGP so
moderator can't read your message in DM,
even if moderator found the link to DM.

================== [Why] =============CSMC
Comic Studio doesn't care about privacy,
they log your IP, disallow VPN/proxy
(which can't avoid) and they can see and
log everything, everywhere.

Only DM are avoidable with PGP.

================= [Usage] ============CSMC
NOTE: RSA KEY ARE NOT SUPPORTED SINCE IT
CREATE BIG DATA AND COMIC STUDIO LIMITED
TO 2500 CHARS, PLEASE USE ECDSA KEY FOR
SMALLER DATA.

You need to APPLY IT EVERYTIME YOU MESSAGE
WITH OTHER USER, as long as your Cookies 
is not cleared.

After install the script, press 
Ctrl + Shift + I, go to console and type 
this command:

importPGPfromText(`
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
...
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
`)

or:

importPGPfromLink("keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1
/by-fingerprint/KEY_ID")

After import public key from browser, you
can now using "Encrypt" button in your
DM.

For decryption (as they use your public
key to encrypt their message), you have to
manually doing it using external software.

For new public key, simply run command
from console again.
