================= [Intro] ============CSMC
csdoom is a script to play DOOM 1993 in
Comic Studio.
Used js-dos for this.

================= [Notes] ============CSMC
1. You must have a legit copy of DOOM
   (MS-DOS) by id Software
2. Pack it with dos.zone/studio
3. Change our previous one with your.

================= [Usage] ============CSMC
1. Install TamperMonkey
2. Select one of these script:

csdoom.user.js            - All studios
csdoom-doomcsonly.user.js - DOOM CS only

3. On GitHub, press "Raw" and TM will
   prompt to install.
